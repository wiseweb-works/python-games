### 1. Nim Game

![](nim_game.webp)
Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") sticks from distinct piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one stick, and may remove maximum of three sticks. Depending on the version being played, the goal of the game is either to avoid taking the last object or to take the last object.

### 2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

![](tic_tac_toe_game.webp)
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

### 2. Connect4 Game

![](connect4_game.webp)
The Connect 4 game is a classic strategy game in which 2 players go head-to-head in a battle to own the grid!

Players choose blue or red discs. They drop the discs into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack their colored discs upwards, horizontally, or diagonally. Use strategy to block opponents while aiming to be the first player to get 4 in a row to win. The Connect 4 game is a great choice for a play date, a rainy day activity, or anytime your kids want a fun game to play with a friend. It's fun to go 4 the win!
